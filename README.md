## About
Soulcare is a project that helps users take care of their own mental health through stress checks, management, AI chatbots, quotes and more. Mental health is so important in modern times, and therapy is expensive, so I've found ways to easily monitor and improve one's own mental health.
Users can take a simple stress test by accessing the app, and can have a conversation with the AI chatbot based on automatically provided results and feedback. Through this, you can take care on your mental state and receive careful counseling. In addition, I have added a push notification (FCM) feature so that users can be notified of quotes tailored to them at any time of the day to stay motivated. The goal is to improve people's quality of life by providing solutions that support users' stress management and well-being.
